# RNA Atlas
**Work in progress**

The analyses presented in the [RNA Atlas paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-00936-1) are the result of concerted efforts by various researchers and analysis workflows. We are working to upload clean scripts for the main results presented in the manuscript.  

  
Users are invited to access and visualize all data in the [RNA Atlas portal](https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi?dscope=RNAATLAS&option=about_dscope). This portal includes genome browser profiles for the total RNA as well as polyA tracks for all samples. All samples can also be used for correlations, differential signals and many more analyses. In addition, the LongHorn results, described in the manuscript, can be explored.  

  
The raw data (FASTQ files) and processed expression measurement tables from all RNA biotypes across samples have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and are accessible through GEO series accession number [GSE138734](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138734).  

In the meantime, readers can contact the authors of the manuscript (lucialorenzi90@gmail.com) with questions or requests for code which will be addressed as soon as possible.
